# Project using nearly all of the elements in various libraries

Having deployment troubles

### Noteworthy features

* Progress bar tracking form completion in Material section
* SOOO many routes in Express. I think I could set the world record for setting up a Rest API. (Stay tuned)
* Doughnut chart
* Full crud functionality in the data table tab in the PrimeNG section
* Plus many more!!
